### This is the best cleaner I've ever made.

So this is a Full Apex Legends trace cleaner. Mostly my friend who wishes to be anonymous sent me this and said it was ok if I posted on UC and I said why not. I added some registry files of my own since I saw it was missing but the rest is his work I'm pretty sure.



This deletes and cleans all Apex/EAC/Origin-related trace files. This works for origin only I think. There are also some files that you need to manually delete every other game. Some files you won't be able to delete because Origin is open but you can delete some files/items within those folders.

The files
```
C:\Users\YOUR PC NAME\AppData\Local\Temp - Delete everything from the folder
C:\Users\YOUR PC NAME\AppData\Local\Origin - Delete origin folder
C:\Users\YOUR PC NAME\AppData\Roaming\Origin - Delete origin folder
C:\Windows\Minidump - Delete all dumps
```



NO THIS WON'T GET YOU UNBANNED. THIS IS SIMPLY A TOOL YOU CAN USE IF YOU'RE HWID BANNED ALONG WITH YOUR SPOOFER.

***

## How To Use

#### 1- Run the batch file as admin

#### 2- Restart your PC

#### 3- When you go to origin right click on apex > Locate game > then locate your game so you don't have to fully reinstall it.

***


### Can I play now without getting banned?

> No. You just cleaned your traces, As explained by someone else (kudos), It's like removing all traces of evidence that you were banned before.

### Spoofing HWID

> After cleaning traces you will have to change the following HWID serials.
```
Baseboard
Bios
CPU
Disks
MAC
```

There are many free spoofing methods (even permanent ones) google will be your best friend.

### Can't find anything?

> Then try making a KVM with GPU integration [Use search function ↗)

### Will this unban my account?

> No, there is no UNBAN TOOL so stop looking for one. Just follow the steps explained make a new account and enjoy.
